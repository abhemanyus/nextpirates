This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## About This Project

This project is to learn and experiment with server-side static generation for improved performance when serving semi-permanent pages.

## Features

- Server-side static generation. 
- No data-fetching required on the client-side.
- Graceful error-handling.
- Lazy image loading
- Component modularity

## To-DO
- UI customization
- More themes
- Commenting
- Separation of data from UI layer
- Change content via JSON
- Replace pseudo-server with actual data
